//! Are these matters still valid?
//! LocationBindings happens on ComputeProgram::compute and RenderProgram::render for consistency. It can be optimized.
//! Each program must maintain its LocationBindings always consistent.
//! Program::use must recover its LocationBindings.
//! The LocationBindings of a Program can be changed between Program::use and render/compute.
//! Checking for consistency on render/compute can be CPU exhaustive. (Current implementation)
//! The current implementation doesn't check if render/compute's specific OpenGL calls (glBindImageTexture, glVertexAttribPointer, uniform) are already consistent.

//!Dirty! Remove LocationBindings, it is no longer used for attributes
